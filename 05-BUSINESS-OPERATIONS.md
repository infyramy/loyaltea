Hi [Business Owner Name],

Thank you for your interest in LoyalTea - The Simplest Loyalty Program!

I'm [Super Admin Name] from the LoyalTea team. I'd love to show you how our system can help increase your customer retention and grow your business.

What I can show you in a 15-minute demo:
✓ How customers get your loyalty card in their phone wallet
✓ How your staff scan and add points/stamps (takes 5 seconds!)
✓ How you manage everything from a simple admin panel
✓ Real examples from other local businesses

When would be a good time for a quick demo? I can visit your location or we can do a video call - whatever works best for you.
